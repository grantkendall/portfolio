                <p class="description">Created during my last year of undergrad at UMKC, this zine is an exploration in how to translate layered digital worlds into a printed format. The translucency of vellum paper was chosen to try and simulate the leakage of data and attention; images never come into focus. Black ink from an inkjet print added a layer of physical compression to the images, flattening and further obscuring their sources.</p>
