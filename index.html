                <p class="description">Created during my last year of undergrad at UMKC, this zine is an exercise in translating layered digital worlds into a printed format. Scenes were composed in game engines and then collaged in layout software. The translucency of vellum paper simulates the leakage of data and attention; context is never focused as windows are rearranged in an operating system. Black ink from an inkjet printer adds a layer of physical compression to the images, flattening and obscuring their context.</p>

Manipulating mundane objects during the scanning process yielded images with iridescent artifacts, invoking jellyfish suspended in dark waters.

                <p class="description">This work began by investigating alternative mapping methods and thinking about typography as landmarks. As such, a book could become a container for statistics, data for the sake of measurement. The frequency of letter usage in the English language is expressed both through the number of letters printed and the size of the circles cut in each page.

Standing in front of the work, the viewer's head is lost in the black enamel void, creating a temporary lack of identity.</p>
